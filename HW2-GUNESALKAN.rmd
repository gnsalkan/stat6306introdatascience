#This is the bar chart of my data science profile

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Skills<-c("Programming","Math","Stat","Machine Learning","Expertise","Communication","Data Viz")
Ratings<-c(3,5,4,1,2,3,2)
barplot(Ratings,names.arg=Skills,col="springgreen1",cex.names=0.70)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
